# Avalon Online
A game of secret identities, deduction and deception.

This is an Elm implementation of [Avalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon)

**About this game:**
* You join a group of players that will go on 5 missions.
* Most players are loyal and will win when the majority of missions are a success.
* Some players are evil and will win when the majority of missions are a failure.
* Each round, the next leader forms a team of trusted players.
* Everyone can vote for or against the team. They can point to a suspected evil player.
* If anyone in the accepted team chooses failure, the mission will be a failure.

I use Elm, because I think it is easier to debug and maintain over time.\
Also, the web application can easily be hosted anywhere and accessed by any browser.

**To run this project:**
* Install Elm
* Run "elm reactor" in the project root directory
* Navigate to src -> Main.elm in the browser

This is a work in progress. I will host an online version if the game is finished.
